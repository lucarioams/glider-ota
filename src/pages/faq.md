# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Glider Travel?

Glider Travel is a travel agency, but a very unique one at that: it's [open](https://github.com/windingtree/glider-ota) [source](https://github.com/windingtree/glider-aggregator), and it connects directly to many hotels, airlines, and other suppliers, via [Winding Tree Marketplace](https://marketplace.windingtree.com).

Glider Travel was created by Winding Tree team in order to show the power of decentralized marketplaces.

## What is Winding Tree Marketplace?

Winding Tree is a decentralized marketplace for companies. Anyone can create an account, prove their identity, and offer their API for access. How is it decentralized, you ask? Well, the account is just an entry in an [Ethereum smart contract](https://github.com/windingtree/org.id). Well, there's a lot more to it, and if you're interested in how it works exactly, please consult [Winding Tree Developer Documentation](https://developers.windingtree.com/).

## What are the benefits of decentralized marketplaces?

Travel, for example, is dominated by just a handful of large companies that impose significant fees (sometimes up to 25%). We are trying to prove that some of the services that these rent-seeking intermediaries provide can be carried out by the marketplace itself, using Ethereum as a backbone, specifically: 1) discovery (search), and 2) business identity verification (or KYB).

It follows that removing these intermediaries should reduce consumer prices and create an environment for innovation through streamlined KYB and more open APIs.

## Surely not everything is as decentralized as you claim to be!

Fair enough. Here's the full disclaimer of how decentralized the marketplace and the travel agency is.

- [ORGiD Smart Contract](https://github.com/windingtree/org.id) - open source; controlled by the team, sometime soon to be transferred to the DAO;
- [ORG.JSON](https://github.com/windingtree/org.json-schema) format - open source;
- [Winding Tree Marketplace website](https://github.com/windingtree/arbor-frontend) - open source;
- [Glider Travel website](https://github.com/windingtree/glider-ota) - open source;
- [Glider Travel backend](https://github.com/windingtree/glider-aggregator) - open source;
- Glider Travel inventory - mixed: part direct, part comes from intermediaries (it would be unusable otherwise).

## Wait, so Glider Travel is centralized?

Yes and no. Yes, because we can turn it off any time. No, because anyone can take the source code and replicate the functionality in no time (we'll even help you do that!). We created Glider to show and inspire others to build travel agencies on top of Winding Tree Marketplace. Our goal is to have thousands of copies of Glider out there.

## What about Bogotá specifically?

We have more than a thousand rooms sourced directly from fourteen Bogotá hotels. Air Canada flight content also comes direct, as well as insurance providers. We are working on improving our offering for Devcon. Other content is sourced via aggregators, but the good thing about it is that we have 80+ airlines. We call this approach Gradual Decentralization. Help us by spreading the word about Winding Tree.

## Awesome! Can I pay with ETH, BTC or ERC20?

Yes, you can! And it will be cheaper for you, too! (You wouldn't believe the state of payment infrastructure in travel...)

## Does your insurance provider covers COVID-19?

Yes, [EKTA](https://travel.ic-ekta.com/) provides medical insurance that covers COVID-19, even if the country you're going to is at risk.

## I want to book travel for the entire team or another request for assistance

Send us an email to [support+devcon@glider.travel](mailto:support+devcon@glider.travel) and we'll help you out.

## Why is booking with crypto cheaper?

All card networks (Visa, Mastercard, AMEX) charge the merchant a fee, usually around 2.5-3.0% + a fixed fee. As a customer you don't see the difference, the merchant is then liable for these fees. But in some countries, especially in Asia, if you are paying with a credit card, your total price will be increased by 3-5%.

Sending crypto is not free, but it could be much cheaper than using a credit card.

## What if I need a refund?

Most bookings on Glider are non-refundable, but try and send us a refund request to [support@glider.travel](mailto:support@glider.travel).

Please note that if you aren't paying in stablecoins, we will be converting your crypto payment to DAI and USDC, so we're not exposed to crypto price fluctuations. If you then request a refund, we can either send you DAI or USDC, and then we'll have to deduct the conversion and transaction fees from your original amount.
